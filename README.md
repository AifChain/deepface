# Face Recognition using Deep Learning

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer.
You can get the technical details from the following paper:
["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832).

## Compatibility
The code is tested using Tensorflow r1.2 under Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5.

## Inspiration
The code is heavily inspired by the [OpenFace](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface) implementation.

## Training data
The [CASIA-WebFace](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html) dataset has been used for training. This training set consists of total of 453 453 images over 10 575 identities after face detection. Some performance improvement has been seen if the dataset has been filtered before training. Some more information about how this was done will come later.
The best performing model has been trained on a subset of the [MS-Celeb-1M](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ms-celeb-1m-challenge-recognizing-one-million-celebrities-real-world/) dataset. This dataset is significantly larger but also contains significantly more label noise, and therefore it is crucial to apply dataset filtering on this dataset.

## Pre-processing

### Face alignment using MTCNN
One problem with the above approach seems to be that the Dlib face detector misses some of the hard examples (partial occlusion, silhouettes, etc). This makes the training set to "easy" which causes the model to perform worse on other benchmarks.
To solve this, other face landmark detectors has been tested. One face landmark detector that has proven to work very well in this setting is the
[Multi-task CNN](https://kpzhang93.github.io/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment/index.html).

## Running training
Currently, the best results are achieved by training the model as a classifier with the addition of [Center loss](http://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf).
